# Convert Subdecks to Tag Hierarchy

This Anki Add-on provides a menu entry to convert the currently active deck's
subdecks into a tag hierarchy.

To activate, restart Anki after installing, and open the parent deck you wish to
convert. Click **Tools→Convert subdecks to tags** to merge all subdecks of the
selected deck and add hierarchical tags.

You may download this add-on by visiting [AnkiWeb](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1172858842),
or by pasting the code `1172858842` into the Anki Add-on installation box
through **Tools→Add-ons→Browse & Install**.

By default, deck names with spaces are separated with dashes (`-`). This can be
configured with the config variable in the add-on page or in `config.json`.
